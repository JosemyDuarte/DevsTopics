# DevsTopics

This project is the engine for [Twitter DevsTopics](https://twitter.com/DevsTopics) and [Telegram DevsTopics](https://t.me/DevsTopics) (more could be added in the near future). The main idea is to provide users with a curated list of Developer Topics with high-quality content from a diverse list of sources through the more convenient medium.
